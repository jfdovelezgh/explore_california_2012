## Sample Website from LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com) course on Git Version Control

Author Kevin Skoglund presents the commands that enable efficient code management and reveals the fundamental concepts 
behind version control systems and the Git architecture. 

Discover how to track changes to files in a repository, review previous edits, and compare versions of a file; 
  create branches to test new ideas without altering the main project; 
  and merge those changes into the project if they work out. 
  
The course begins by demonstrating version control in a single-user, standalone context, 
before exploring how remote repositories allow users to collaborate on projects effectively.
